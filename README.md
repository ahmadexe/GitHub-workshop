# GitHub-workshop
Git is a distributed version control system that is widely used by developers to manage source code and collaborate on software projects. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories that provides additional features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools. GitHub has become a central hub for open source software development, with millions of developers and organizations hosting and contributing to projects on the platform. Open source software refers to software whose source code is made available to the public, allowing anyone to view, modify, and distribute the code. Open source software encourages collaboration and innovation, as developers can work together to improve existing software and create new tools and applications.


## Our Motivation
Git and GitHub are essential tools for students of computer science as they provide a platform to learn and practice version control, collaborate on software projects, and build a portfolio of work to showcase their skills to potential employers. Git enables students to track changes made to their code, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with others on the same project without fear of losing their work. GitHub provides a platform for students to share their code with others, receive feedback and contributions, and learn from others' code. It also allows students to contribute to open-source projects and build a network of connections with other developers. Additionally, using Git and GitHub can improve a student's productivity, as they can work on their projects from anywhere, easily share their work with others, and keep track of changes and updates made by themselves or others. Overall, mastering Git and GitHub is a crucial skill for any computer science student looking to pursue a career in software development.


## IEEE CS CUI x GitHub
IEEE CS CUI hosted an introductory session on Git and GitHub for the students to get familiarized with these tools. Student took part in the event, discussed their doubts and made their first ever repository!
